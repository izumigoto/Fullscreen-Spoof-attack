# Fullscreen-Spoof-attack
This repository contains the code for Fullscreen Spoof attack POC .


## Details

Fullscreen Spoof attack is when browsers does not alert the users when they enter fullscreen mode.This vulnerability can be chained by the attackers to Spoof trusted sites.


```
That would be a Fullscreen Spoofing vulnerability. It allows an attacker to create a fake UI (e.g., a fake browser address bar or security prompt) by hiding the real interface. If the browser does not show a security alert when entering fullscreen, users may be tricked into believing they are on a trusted website while actually being on a phishing page.
